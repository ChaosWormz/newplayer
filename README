newplayer
=========

This mod adds a form containing the rules that is shown to players without interact when they join. They are also teleported to a special spawn point designated for players without interact.
If they press "I agree", they are teleported to the normal spawn. The /spawn command will also take them back there (or to the non-interact spawn if they don't have interact).
If they press "I do not agree", they are allowed to play normally (but without interact), although bright red text will be placed in the middle of the screen explaining the situation.
At any point, the /rules command will show the rules. The /set_interact_spawn and /set_no_interact_spawn commands (requiring the server priv) will set the respective spawn point to your current location.
To set the rules, either place a file called "newplayer-rules.txt" in the world directory, press the "Edit" button at the rules screen, or use the /editrules command (the latter two methods require the "server" priv). If this file does not exist, the mod will tell you where to create it if you attempt to view the rules.

If a keyword is set (Use /set_keyword to set it or /get_keyword to see what it's set to, both require server privs. It can also be edited from the rules editor.), then players will have to enter it into a provided text box before clicking the agree button. It is then possible to put the string "@KEYWORD" in the rules, which will be replaced with the keyword when they are shown to a player without interact. This substitution (intentionally) does not occur when the rules are being shown to somebody with interact (for example, if they use the /rules command because they want to re-read them)* so that they can't see the keyword, preventing them from telling other players what it is provided that it is changed freqently enough.
If a keyword is not set, players are not asked for it and simply pressing the "I agree" button is enough.

* Like that ever happens.
